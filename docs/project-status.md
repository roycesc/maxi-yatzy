# Project Status: Maxi Yatzy

**Last Updated:** `Date.now()`

## Overview

This document tracks the current status of the Maxi Yatzy project, highlighting completed features, known issues, and upcoming work items.

## Gameplay Logic

- ✅ **Core Game Mechanics**: All core gameplay logic is working as intended, including:
  - ✅ Six dice rolling with proper randomization
  - ✅ Dice selection/holding between rolls
  - ✅ Accurate score calculation for all categories
  - ✅ Turn-based player progression
  - ✅ Win condition detection
  - ✅ **FIXED**: First player now correctly gets three rolls (including auto-roll) on initial turn, matching other players' turns

## UI/UX Status

- ⚠️ **Mobile Responsiveness**: Needs improvement for smaller screens
- ⚠️ **Animations**: Dice rolling animations can be improved
- ⚠️ **Accessibility**: Not yet fully compliant with WCAG standards
- ⚠️ **Sound Effects**: Not yet implemented
- ⚠️ **Visual Feedback**: Needs enhancement for clearer player turn indication

## Authentication/Backend

- ❌ **User Authentication**: Known issues with authentication logic
  - User session management needs refinement
  - Email verification flow incomplete
  - Password reset functionality missing
- ❌ **Game State Persistence**: Real-time synchronization needs work
- ⚠️ **Player Profiles**: Basic implementation in place, but needs enhancement

## Testing

- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Core game logic (dice, scoring) has good test coverage
- ⚠️ **Integration Tests**: Minimal coverage, needs expansion
- ❌ **E2E Tests**: Not yet implemented

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication Logic**: Multiple issues with user registration and login flows
2. **UI Polish**: Game interface needs additional refinement, especially on mobile devices
3. **Performance**: Occasional lag during dice animations on slower devices

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Fix authentication issues
2. Enhance mobile UI responsiveness
3. Implement remaining UI features (sound effects, better animations)

### Medium Priority
1. Improve testing coverage
2. Enhance player profiles
3. Optimize performance

### Low Priority
1. Add additional game variants
2. Implement social features
3. Create tournament mode

## Resolved Issues

| Date | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| Current Date | First player only getting one roll on initial turn | Fixed dice rolling logic in `dice-container.tsx` to ensure first player gets all three rolls, including the automatic first roll |
