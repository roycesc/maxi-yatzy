# Project Status: Maxi Yatzy

**Last Updated:** April 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the current status of the Maxi Yatzy project, highlighting completed features, known issues, and upcoming work items.

## Build Status

- ✅ **Production Build**: The application now builds successfully with `npm run build`
  - ✅ Fixed React Hook dependency warnings in useEffect hooks
  - ✅ Fixed unescaped entity errors by using proper HTML entities
  - ✅ Added proper ESLint configuration to disable problematic rules
  - ✅ Implemented useCallback to optimize component re-renders

## Gameplay Logic

- ✅ **Core Game Mechanics**: All core gameplay logic is working as intended, including:
  - ✅ Six dice rolling with proper randomization
  - ✅ Dice selection/holding between rolls
  - ✅ Accurate score calculation for all categories
  - ✅ Turn-based player progression
  - ✅ Win condition detection
  - ✅ **FIXED**: First player now correctly gets three rolls (including auto-roll) on initial turn, matching other players' turns

## Authentication System

- ✅ **User Registration**: Email-based registration implemented
  - ✅ Email validation and uniqueness check
  - ✅ Password hashing and security
  - ✅ Automatic sign-in after registration
  - ✅ Game-specific user fields (coins, wins, losses)
- ✅ **Session Management**: NextAuth.js integration
  - ✅ JWT-based session handling
  - ✅ 30-day session duration
  - ✅ Proper session callbacks
- ⚠️ **Remaining Auth Tasks**:
  - Email verification flow
  - Password reset functionality
  - OAuth provider integration
  - Session persistence improvements

## UI/UX Status

- ⚠️ **Mobile Responsiveness**: Needs improvement for smaller screens
  - Current layout needs optimization for screens below 640px
  - Touch targets need adjustment for better mobile interaction
  - Score card visibility needs improvement on small screens
- ⚠️ **Animations**: Dice rolling animations can be improved
  - Current animations are basic and could be more engaging
  - Need to implement smoother transitions between states
  - Consider adding particle effects for special rolls
- ⚠️ **Accessibility**: Not yet fully compliant with WCAG standards
  - Missing proper ARIA labels
  - Color contrast needs verification
  - Keyboard navigation incomplete
- ⚠️ **Sound Effects**: Not yet implemented
  - Core SFX needed for dice rolls, scoring, and UI interactions
  - Need to implement sound toggle and volume control
  - Consider ambient background music
- ⚠️ **Visual Feedback**: Needs enhancement for clearer player turn indication
  - Current turn indicator could be more prominent
  - Need better visual cues for available actions
  - Score previews could be more intuitive

## Database & Backend

- ✅ **Prisma Schema**: Updated with proper relations
  - ✅ User model with game-specific fields
  - ✅ Proper relations between User and VerificationToken
  - ✅ Game and GamePlayer models with proper constraints
- ⚠️ **Game State Persistence**: Real-time synchronization needs work
  - WebSocket implementation needed for real-time updates
  - Game state recovery after disconnection
  - Conflict resolution for concurrent actions
- ⚠️ **Player Profiles**: Basic implementation in place, but needs enhancement
  - Profile customization options needed
  - Statistics tracking incomplete
  - Achievement system not implemented

## Testing

- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Core game logic (dice, scoring) has good test coverage
  - Dice rolling and scoring functions well tested
  - Game simulation tests implemented
  - Need to expand test coverage for edge cases
- ⚠️ **Integration Tests**: Minimal coverage, needs expansion
  - API route tests needed
  - Database interaction tests incomplete
  - Authentication flow tests missing
- ❌ **E2E Tests**: Not yet implemented
  - Need to set up Cypress or Playwright
  - Critical user flows need testing
  - Mobile testing infrastructure needed

## Code Quality

- ✅ **ESLint Configuration**: Updated to properly handle React requirements
- ✅ **TypeScript Type Safety**: Improved typing for game state management
- ✅ **React Best Practices**: Implemented useCallback for performance optimization
- ⚠️ **Code Documentation**: Needs improvement in some areas
  - Some components lack proper JSDoc comments
  - Complex logic needs better documentation
  - API documentation incomplete

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication Logic**: Multiple issues with user registration and login flows
   - Session persistence problems
   - Email verification not working
   - Password reset functionality missing
2. **UI Polish**: Game interface needs additional refinement, especially on mobile devices
   - Layout issues on small screens
   - Touch interaction improvements needed
   - Visual feedback enhancements required
3. **Performance**: Occasional lag during dice animations on slower devices
   - Animation optimization needed
   - State management could be more efficient
   - Asset loading needs optimization
